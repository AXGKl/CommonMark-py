CommonMark-py
=============

Pure Python port of [jgm](https://github.com/jgm)'s [stmd.js](https://github.com/jgm/stmd/blob/master/js/stmd.js), a Markdown parser and renderer for the [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org) specification. Once both this project and the CommonMark specification are stable we will release the first `1.0` version and attempt to keep up to date with changes in `stmd.js`.

When the project is semi-stable we will move to a Python package format (PyPi) and include both a module and cli tool to render HTML (also some format to represent the intermediate AST, and maybe other things like PDF, etc) files from Markdown files.

(**Note**: This is a work in progress! **81**/**362** tests currently passing)
